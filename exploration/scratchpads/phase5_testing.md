# Phase 5: Testing Framework Scratchpad

## Current Status
- Existing tests focus on unit testing individual components
- Basic pipeline integration test exists but needs expansion
- No performance benchmarks or quality metrics
- No continuous monitoring setup

## Testing Framework Plan

### 1. Integration Test Suite Architecture

#### Directory Structure
```
tests/
â”œâ”€â”€ integration/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ __init__.py
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ test_end_to_end_pipeline.py
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ test_graph_consistency.py
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ test_vector_search_accuracy.py
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ test_data_quality.py
â”œâ”€â”€ benchmarks/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ __init__.py
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ benchmark_extraction.py
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ benchmark_search.py
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ benchmark_graph_queries.py
â””â”€â”€ fixtures/
    â”œâ”€â”€ __init__.py
    â”œâ”€â”€ ground_truth_data.json
    â””â”€â”€ test_documents.json
```

### 2. Quality Metrics Framework

#### Key Metrics to Track
1. **Extraction Quality**
   - Precision/Recall/F1 for each entity type
   - Relationship extraction accuracy
   - Deduplication effectiveness

2. **Search Quality**
   - Precision@K (K=5, 10, 20)
   - Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR)
   - Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG)

3. **Performance Metrics**
   - Extraction latency per chunk
   - Vector search response time
   - Graph query execution time
   - Memory usage patterns

4. **Data Quality**
   - Entity completeness scores
   - Relationship consistency
   - Embedding quality (similarity scores)

### 3. Implementation Steps

#### Step 1: Create Test Infrastructure
- Set up integration test directory
- Create shared fixtures for test data
- Implement ground truth dataset

#### Step 2: Build End-to-End Tests
- Complete pipeline test (split â†’ extract â†’ deduplicate â†’ embed â†’ load)
- Error recovery tests
- Concurrent processing tests

#### Step 3: Implement Quality Metrics
- Extraction accuracy calculator
- Search relevance evaluator
- Graph consistency validator

#### Step 4: Create Performance Benchmarks
- Micro-benchmarks for each operation
- Load testing scenarios
- Resource usage profiling

#### Step 5: Set Up Monitoring
- Quality metric tracking
- Performance trend analysis
- Automated alerting system

### 4. Test Data Strategy

#### Ground Truth Dataset
Create manually verified test cases covering:
- 20 bands with complete information
- 50 people with roles and relationships
- 30 albums with release details
- Various relationship types
- Edge cases (name variations, typos)

#### Test Document Set
- Small: 5 chunks for quick tests
- Medium: 50 chunks for integration tests
- Large: 500+ chunks for performance tests

### 5. Critical Test Scenarios

1. **Deduplication Edge Cases**
   - Name variations: "Black Sabbath" vs "Black Sabath" vs "B. Sabbath"
   - Partial information merge
   - Conflicting data resolution

2. **Extraction Challenges**
   - Complex sentences with multiple entities
   - Implicit relationships
   - Historical context preservation

3. **Search Relevance**
   - Semantic similarity ("British metal" â†’ UK bands)
   - Multi-entity queries
   - Time-based filtering

4. **Graph Integrity**
   - Relationship consistency
   - No orphaned nodes
   - Bidirectional relationship validation

### 6. Automation Strategy

#### CI/CD Integration
- Run unit tests on every commit
- Integration tests on PR
- Performance benchmarks weekly
- Quality metrics dashboard

#### Regression Detection
- Baseline metrics storage
- Automated comparison
- Alert on degradation > 5%

### 7. Next Actions

1. Create integration test directory structure
2. Implement end-to-end pipeline test
3. Build ground truth dataset
4. Create quality metric calculators
5. Set up performance benchmarking
6. Document testing guidelines
