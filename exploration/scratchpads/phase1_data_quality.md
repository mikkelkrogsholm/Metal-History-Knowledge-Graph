# Phase 1: Data Quality Assessment Scratchpad

## Working Log

### 2025-07-19 - Initial Setup
- Read agent instructions
- Starting with Task 1: Creating graph analysis tool
- Database location confirmed: `schema/metal_history.db`
- Entities file: `deduplicated_entities.json`

## Task Progress

### Task 1: Graph Analysis Tool Development
- [x] Create `scripts/analysis/graph_explorer.py`
- [x] Count all node types and relationships
- [x] Calculate graph density metrics
- [x] Identify disconnected components
- [x] Find orphaned nodes
- [x] Generate statistics report

### Task 2: Extraction Quality Testing
- [x] Select 10 diverse chunks (5 test cases created)
- [x] Manually identify expected entities
- [x] Run extraction and compare
- [x] Calculate precision, recall, F1
- [ ] Document failure patterns (need more test cases)

### Task 3: Completeness Analysis
- [x] Compare current vs enhanced schema
- [x] List unused entity types (13/16 unused!)
- [x] Identify missing relationships
- [x] Find coverage gaps
- [x] Prioritize improvements

## Key Findings Summary

### ğŸš¨ Critical Issues
1. **Data Loading Failed**: Only 4/51 entities loaded (7.8% success rate)
   - Primary cause: ID type mismatch (STRING vs INT64)
   - Secondary: Schema property mismatches
   
2. **Minimal Graph Coverage**: 
   - Only 3/16 node types used
   - Only 1 relationship type (RELEASED)
   - 50% of nodes are orphaned

3. **Processing Incomplete**:
   - Only 4/62 chunks processed (6.5%)
   - Missing entire entity categories

### âœ… Strengths
1. **Extraction Quality**: 100% accuracy on test cases
2. **Deduplication Working**: Successfully merged entities
3. **Tool Infrastructure**: Analysis tools created and working

### ğŸ“‹ Top Priorities
1. Fix `load_to_kuzu.py` - ID type and property mapping
2. Extract GeographicLocation entities separately
3. Implement MEMBER_OF relationships
4. Process remaining 58 chunks

### ğŸ“Š Metrics
- Entities extracted: 51
- Entities in database: 4
- Schema utilization: 18.75%
- Graph density: 0.083
- Extraction accuracy: 100% (on tests)

## Notes
- Starting with graph analysis to understand current state
- Will need to check if database exists and has data

## Initial Findings

### Database vs Extracted Data Mismatch
- **Deduplicated entities JSON**: 51 total entities
  - Bands: 9
  - People: 30
  - Albums: 5
  - Songs: 4
  - Subgenres: 2
  - Events: 1
- **Database**: Only 4 nodes!
  - Bands: 2 (Black Sabbath, Iron Maiden)
  - People: 1 (Tony Iommi)
  - Albums: 1
  - Relationships: 1 (RELEASED)

**Critical Issue**: The data loading process is not working properly. Only ~8% of entities made it to the database.

### Graph Statistics (Current State)
- Total Nodes: 4
- Total Relationships: 1
- Average Degree: 0.25
- Graph Density: 0.083333
- Isolated entities: Iron Maiden (band), Tony Iommi (person)

### Schema Coverage
- Used node types: Band, Person, Album (3/16 types)
- Unused node types: 13 types including Song, Subgenre, Event, Label, Tour, etc.
- Missing critical relationships: MEMBER_OF (Person -> Band)
