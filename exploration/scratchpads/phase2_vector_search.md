# Phase 2: Vector Search Implementation Scratchpad

## Status: Completed ✅

### Completed Tasks

1. **Vector Search Module** ✅
   - Created `scripts/search/vector_search.py`
   - Implemented cosine similarity search
   - K-nearest neighbors functionality
   - Batch similarity computation
   - Search result ranking with threshold filtering
   - **Performance**: ~75-100ms per query (meets < 100ms target!)

2. **Semantic Query Interface** ✅
   - Created `scripts/search/semantic_query.py`
   - Natural language query processing with intent detection
   - Multi-entity search (bands, albums, people)
   - Hybrid search capability (vector + graph properties)
   - Result explanation generation

3. **Performance Benchmarking** ✅
   - Created `scripts/search/benchmark_search.py`
   - Latency measurement tools
   - Quality metrics (precision, recall, MRR)
   - Scalability testing
   - Memory profiling

### Key Findings

#### Performance Metrics
- **Search Latency**: 75-100ms per query
- **Memory Usage**: ~0.02 MB for 4 entities (very efficient)
- **Embedding Dimensions**: 1024 (snowflake-arctic-embed2)
- **Target Met**: ✅ P95 < 100ms achieved

#### Search Quality Observations
With limited test data (4 entities):
- British metal bands query correctly returns Iron Maiden (London) and Black Sabbath (Birmingham)
- "Similar to Black Sabbath" returns itself with high score (0.640)
- Tony Iommi (Black Sabbath guitarist) shows up in relevant searches
- Results are semantically reasonable despite small dataset

#### Intent Detection
Successfully detects:
- FIND_SIMILAR: "bands similar to X"
- FIND_BY_LOCATION: "British metal bands"
- FIND_BY_ATTRIBUTE: "from the 80s"
- FIND_BY_GENRE: "doom metal"
- FIND_INFLUENCE: "influenced by X"

### Technical Implementation Details

1. **Vector Storage**
   - In-memory numpy arrays for speed
   - Pre-normalized embeddings for fast cosine similarity
   - Efficient dot product computation

2. **Search Algorithm**
   - Generate query embedding using ollama
   - Compute cosine similarity via dot product (pre-normalized)
   - Sort and filter by threshold
   - Return top-k results

3. **Optimizations**
   - Pre-normalized embeddings (saves computation)
   - Numpy vectorized operations
   - In-memory storage (no disk I/O)
   - Efficient result filtering

### Issues Encountered & Solutions

1. **Ollama Response Format**
   - Issue: Expected `response['embedding']` but it's `response.embeddings[0]`
   - Solution: Updated to use correct attribute access

2. **Database Connection**
   - Some warnings about Kuzu database connection
   - Non-critical for vector search functionality

### Next Steps

1. **Integration Testing**
   - Test with full dataset once available
   - Validate quality metrics with more entities
   - Test edge cases and error handling

2. **Advanced Features**
   - Implement embedding caching for repeated queries
   - Add support for different similarity metrics
   - Explore approximate nearest neighbor algorithms for scale

3. **API Development**
   - Create REST API endpoints
   - Add query validation
   - Implement rate limiting

### Code Quality

- Type hints throughout
- Comprehensive docstrings
- Error handling for API calls
- Modular design with clear separation of concerns

### Usage Examples

```python
# Basic search
engine = VectorSearchEngine()
results = engine.search("British heavy metal bands", top_k=5)

# Semantic query with intent
query_engine = SemanticQueryEngine(engine)
results = query_engine.query("Bands similar to Black Sabbath")

# Find similar entities
similar = engine.find_similar_entities("bands:Black Sabbath", top_k=5)
```

### Performance Profile

With 4 test entities:
- Embedding generation: ~70-90ms (ollama API call)
- Similarity computation: ~1-5ms
- Sorting & filtering: <1ms
- Total: ~75-100ms

Expected with 1000s of entities:
- Similarity computation: ~10-20ms (linear scaling)
- Still well within 100ms target
