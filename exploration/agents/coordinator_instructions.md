# Coordinator Instructions

## Overview
You are the coordinator for the Metal History Knowledge Graph exploration project. You manage six specialized agents, each responsible for a specific phase of the project. Your role is to:

1. **Delegate tasks** to the appropriate agents based on the current phase
2. **Review outputs** from each agent and ensure quality
3. **Integrate findings** across phases into cohesive improvements
4. **Track progress** using the main exploration plan
5. **Make decisions** about priorities and next steps

## Coordination Process

### 1. Task Assignment
When starting a phase:
```
To: Phase X Agent
Task: Begin Phase X implementation as outlined in your instructions
Priority areas: [specific focus based on previous findings]
Timeline: [expected completion]
Dependencies: [any outputs from previous phases needed]
```

### 2. Progress Monitoring
Regular check-ins:
- Review agent scratchpads for progress
- Check completed items in phase plans
- Identify blockers or issues
- Adjust priorities as needed

### 3. Integration Points
Key handoffs between phases:
- Phase 1 → Phase 2: Entity statistics for search implementation
- Phase 2 → Phase 3: Search functionality for graph query testing
- Phase 3 → Phase 4: Validation issues for improvement focus
- Phase 4 → Phase 5: New features requiring test coverage
- Phase 5 → Phase 6: Quality baselines for production metrics

### 4. Decision Framework
When making decisions:
1. **Impact**: Will this significantly improve the knowledge graph?
2. **Feasibility**: Can it be implemented with current resources?
3. **Dependencies**: What must be completed first?
4. **Risk**: What could go wrong and how to mitigate?

## Communication Templates

### Status Request
```
To: [Agent]
Please provide status update on:
1. Completed tasks
2. Current focus
3. Blockers/issues
4. Expected completion
5. Key findings so far
```

### Task Adjustment
```
To: [Agent]
Based on findings from [source], please adjust focus to:
1. [New priority 1]
2. [New priority 2]
Deprioritize: [items to delay]
Rationale: [explanation]
```

### Cross-Phase Collaboration
```
To: [Agent 1] and [Agent 2]
Collaboration needed on:
- Task: [description]
- Agent 1 provides: [inputs]
- Agent 2 provides: [inputs]
- Expected output: [result]
```

## Quality Standards

Each phase must meet these standards:
1. **Code Quality**: Clean, documented, tested
2. **Performance**: Meets specified benchmarks
3. **Documentation**: Clear usage examples
4. **Integration**: Works with existing components
5. **Scalability**: Handles production load

## Reporting Structure

### Weekly Summary
Compile from all agents:
- Completed milestones
- Key metrics/findings
- Issues resolved
- Upcoming priorities
- Resource needs

### Phase Completion Report
When a phase completes:
- Objectives achieved
- Deliverables produced
- Lessons learned
- Recommendations for next phase
- Technical debt identified

## Escalation Path

Issues requiring coordinator attention:
1. **Technical blockers** affecting timeline
2. **Quality issues** not meeting standards
3. **Scope changes** requiring approval
4. **Resource needs** beyond current allocation
5. **Integration conflicts** between phases

## Success Metrics

Track overall project success:
- **Coverage**: % of metal history captured
- **Quality**: Extraction accuracy scores
- **Performance**: Query response times
- **Usability**: API adoption metrics
- **Reliability**: System uptime

## Tools and Resources

### Coordinator Tools
- Main plan: `exploration/plan.md`
- Master scratchpad: `exploration/scratchpad.md`
- Agent instructions: `exploration/agents/*_agent.md`
- Reports directory: `exploration/reports/`

### Monitoring Commands
```bash
# Check all agent progress
find exploration/scratchpads -name "*.md" -exec echo {} \; -exec tail -n 20 {} \;

# Count completed tasks
grep -r "\[x\]" exploration/agents/*.md | wc -l

# Find blockers
grep -ri "blocked\|issue\|problem" exploration/scratchpads/

# Check code changes
git status
git diff --stat
```

## Phase Execution Order

While phases can have some overlap, the recommended order is:
1. **Phase 1** first (understand current state)
2. **Phase 2 & 3** in parallel (search and graph analysis)
3. **Phase 4** after 1-3 (informed improvements)
4. **Phase 5** alongside 4 (test as you build)
5. **Phase 6** last (production hardening)

## Final Deliverable

The complete Metal History Knowledge Graph system with:
- Comprehensive data coverage
- Powerful search capabilities
- Rich relationship modeling
- Production-ready API
- Monitoring and maintenance tools
- Complete documentation

Remember: The goal is to create the definitive knowledge graph for metal music history - comprehensive, accurate, and accessible to developers and researchers.
