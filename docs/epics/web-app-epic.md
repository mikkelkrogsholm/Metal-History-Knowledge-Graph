# Epic: Web Application for Metal History Knowledge Graph - Implementation Plan

## Overview
This epic establishes a web application for exploring the Metal History Knowledge Graph using FastAPI with Jinja2 templates and Tailwind CSS, creating a server-rendered application with minimal complexity and moving parts.

## Issues Created
- [ ] #1: [Epic] Build FastAPI Web App with Jinja2 Templates for Graph Exploration (Epic Tracker)
- [ ] #2: [Epic: Web App] Set up Jinja2 templates and Tailwind CSS integration (Size: S)
- [ ] #3: [Epic: Web App] Create base layout and navigation templates (Size: M)
- [ ] #4: [Epic: Web App] Implement entity browsing pages with server-side rendering (Size: L)
- [ ] #5: [Epic: Web App] Add search functionality with HTMX for interactivity (Size: M)
- [ ] #6: [Epic: Web App] Implement graph visualization with progressive enhancement (Size: L)
- [ ] #7: [Epic: Web App] Add server-side caching and optimizations (Size: M)

## Implementation Order
1. **Foundation** (#2): Set up Jinja2 templating and integrate Tailwind CSS via CDN
2. **Framework** (#3): Create base templates with layout inheritance
3. **Core Features** (#4): Implement server-rendered band and album pages
4. **Enhanced Navigation** (#5): Add search with HTMX for dynamic updates
5. **Signature Feature** (#6): Build graph visualization with progressive enhancement
6. **Polish** (#7): Optimize with server-side caching and template caching

## Success Metrics
- **User Engagement**: Users spend >5 minutes exploring the graph
- **Performance**: Page loads <2 seconds, Lighthouse score >90
- **Usability**: Search returns results in <500ms
- **Reliability**: 99.9% uptime, graceful error handling
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance

## Technical Decisions
1. **Template Engine**: Jinja2 (built into FastAPI)
   - Rationale: Server-side rendering, no separate frontend build needed
2. **Interactivity**: HTMX + Alpine.js for progressive enhancement
   - Rationale: Minimal JavaScript, server-driven interactions
3. **Graph Library**: D3.js loaded only on visualization pages
   - Rationale: Keep it simple, load libraries only when needed
4. **Styling**: Tailwind CSS via CDN
   - Rationale: No build step required, instant development

## Risk Mitigation
- **Graph Performance**: Implement level-of-detail rendering for large graphs
- **API Latency**: Add client-side caching and optimistic updates
- **Browser Compatibility**: Target modern browsers, provide fallbacks
- **Mobile Experience**: Design mobile-first, test on real devices

## Future Enhancements (Not in Scope)
- User accounts and authentication
- Playlist/favorite creation
- Social features (sharing, comments)
- Advanced graph algorithms (shortest path, centrality)
- Music player integration
- Data contribution/editing interface

## Definition of Success
The web application successfully launches when:
1. Users can browse all entities via server-rendered pages
2. Search works seamlessly with HTMX-powered updates
3. Graph visualization loads progressively without blocking
4. Server response time <200ms for most pages
5. Application works on desktop and mobile without JavaScript
6. All child issues are completed with integration tests
