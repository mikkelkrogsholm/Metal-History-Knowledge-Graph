# History of Heavy Metal (1960s–2025)

## 1960s–1970s: Proto-Metal and Birth of a Genre

Heavy metal music emerged in the late 1960s and early 1970s in Britain and the United States, with roots in blues rock, psychedelic rock, and acid rock. Early pioneers like **Led Zeppelin**, **Black Sabbath**, and **Deep Purple** formed in 1968 and forged a “thick, monumental sound” driven by distorted guitar riffs, heavy bass-and-drum grooves, and powerful vocals. Black Sabbath – often credited as inventors of heavy metal’s dark tonality – drew on the bleak industrial atmosphere of their hometown, Birmingham. The band members grew up in the post-war, factory-filled Midlands, a working-class environment far removed from the late-’60s “Summer of Love” optimism. This gritty backdrop shaped Sabbath’s haunting riffs and pessimistic lyrics, aligning with a youth culture that was becoming disillusioned with hippie idealism. As Ozzy Osbourne recalled, *“When I heard the silly words ‘If you’re going to San Francisco, be sure to wear a flower in your hair,’ I wanted to strangle John Phillips… I was sitting in industrial Birmingham… I hated the world”* – a sentiment that found its way into the aggressive, rebellious tone of early heavy metal.

**Musical Influences & Characteristics:** The first metal bands were essentially louder, heavier offshoots of blues-rock. Tony Iommi of Black Sabbath famously down-tuned his guitar after a factory accident severed his fingertip, making it easier to bend strings and producing a heavier, doom-laden sound. Sabbath’s eponymous 1970 song even used the dissonant **tritone** (the “devil’s interval”), a note combination historically shunned in classical music for its evil sound. Alongside Sabbath’s lumbering **doom** riffs (rooted in blues but played at a sinister crawl), Led Zeppelin introduced booming hard-rock rhythms and virtuosic guitar solos blending blues scales with folk and eastern influences. Deep Purple injected classical music virtuosity (e.g. Jon Lord’s baroque-inspired organ solos) and faster tempos into the mix. Early heavy metal was thus characterized by **downtempo bluesy grooves** (“doom”) on one hand and **up-tempo, riff-driven hard rock** on the other, with extended guitar solos and emphatic, often swinging rhythms. Vocal styles ranged from Zeppelin’s Robert Plant’s bluesy wails to Sabbath’s Ozzy Osbourne’s eerie, nasal tenor – but all were delivered with a **powerful, aggressive** edge that conveyed intensity and dark emotion. Lyrically, themes of occultism, dystopia, and rebellion set metal apart from the peace-and-love ethos of 1960s rock. By the early ’70s, critics often derided “heavy metal” as a pejorative for music that was *“loud, thrashing… aggressive”*, but a devoted **fan subculture** (“metalheads” or “headbangers”) was already forming around this loud new music.

**Key Genres & Scenes:** In the 1970s, *heavy metal was not yet splintered into many subgenres* – it was essentially the evolving sound of hard rock growing heavier. However, important **proto-subgenres** took shape. **Shock rock**, led by **Alice Cooper** in the early ’70s, fused macabre theatrical stage shows with hard rock (e.g. Cooper’s *Love It to Death* (1971)), influencing heavy metal’s flair for horror and spectacle. **Glam-influenced hard rock** arose through acts like **Kiss** (formed 1973), who used makeup, anthemic choruses, and theatrical bombast that presaged the ’80s glam metal wave. Across the Atlantic, British bands pushed metal’s technical and aggressive limits: **Judas Priest** from Birmingham stripped away the remaining blues influences by the mid-’70s, pioneering a **faster, twin-lead-guitar** attack and a leather-and-studs look that defined metal’s image. Meanwhile, **Motörhead** (formed 1975 in London) bridged punk and metal, introducing a gritty punk rock sensibility and **emphasizing speed** and volume over blues groove. Motörhead’s overdriven bass and breakneck tempos on albums like *Overkill* (1979) essentially prefigured **speed metal** and thrash. This cross-pollination with punk energized the UK metal scene just as punk rock itself exploded in 1977. In the late ’70s, the next generation of British metal bands took these innovations and ran: the **New Wave of British Heavy Metal (NWOBHM)** was born. Young UK acts like **Iron Maiden** (London), **Saxon** (Barnsley), **Def Leppard** (Sheffield), **Diamond Head** (Stourbridge) and many more emerged around 1978–1980, infusing the **speed of Motörhead and punk** with the **twin-guitar harmonies and high-pitched vocals** of classic metal. NWOBHM bands were typically **DIY in attitude**, trading polished production for raw energy – a reflection of late ’70s youth discontent in recession-era Britain. The movement’s geographic hotbed was England (especially industrial cities and London’s club circuit), but its impact was international as NWOBHM records circulated via tape-trading to Europe and the U.S.

**Notable Bands & Albums:** *Black Sabbath’s* debut ***Black Sabbath* (1970)** is widely cited as the **first heavy metal album**, with the ominous title track introducing doom riffs and occult theming. *Deep Purple’s* ***Machine Head* (1972)** (featuring “Smoke on the Water”) became a template for driving heavy rock riffs and virtuosic solos. *Led Zeppelin* pushed blues rock to thunderous extremes on songs like “Whole Lotta Love” (1969) and the epic “Achilles Last Stand” (1976). *Judas Priest’s* ***Sad Wings of Destiny* (1976)** and ***Stained Class* (1978)** defined the **classic heavy metal** sound – fast dual-guitar riffing (K. K. Downing and Glenn Tipton), Rob Halford’s soaring operatic vocals, and a complete break from blues clichés. In the U.S., *Aerosmith*’s ***Toys in the Attic* (1975)** gave a bluesy American hard-rock spin that influenced later glam metal, while *Kiss*’ ***Alive!* (1975)** captured the bombastic live energy that metal showmanship would embrace. The late ’70s NWOBHM era produced influential records such as *Iron Maiden’s* ***Iron Maiden* (1980)** and ***The Number of the Beast* (1982)** (the latter introducing Bruce Dickinson’s operatic vocals and hitting #1 in the UK), *Saxon’s* ***Wheels of Steel* (1980)**, and *Def Leppard’s* ***On Through the Night* (1980)**. Though Def Leppard would later turn toward polished hard rock, their early work and that of bands like *Diamond Head* (***Lightning to the Nations* (1980)**) directly inspired metal’s next generation – most famously, Metallica would cover Diamond Head and other NWOBHM songs in the early ’80s. By decade’s end, **heavy metal** was a defined genre and lifestyle: fans in denim and leather headbanged to loud riffs, and a new decade was poised to splinter metal into numerous directions. **Legacy & Influence:** The 1960s–70s era laid the **groundwork for every metal subgenre** that followed. Black Sabbath’s down-tuned doom and occult themes would resurface in doom, stoner, and gothic metal. Judas Priest and NWOBHM’s **frenetic riffing and galloping rhythms** directly gave rise to speed metal, thrash, and power metal in the ’80s. The **metal “look”** – long hair, leather, spikes – coalesced in this era (thanks to Priest, Motörhead and others), establishing a visual culture. Perhaps most importantly, the 1970s built metal’s **culture of louder-faster innovation**: each new band tried to be heavier or more outrageous than the last, a competitive ethos that would drive metal’s evolution in coming decades.

## 1980s: The Golden Age – Thrash versus Glam, and the Rise of Extremes

The 1980s saw heavy metal explode into the mainstream *and* fission into a spectrum of new subgenres, from glossy pop-metal to the fiercest extremes. In the early ’80s, the **NWOBHM** continued to surge – bands like Iron Maiden, Saxon, and **Def Leppard** achieved international success (Def Leppard’s *Pyromania* (1983) and *Hysteria* (1987) brought a catchy, polished sheen to metal on MTV). Simultaneously, metal’s **center of gravity expanded to the United States**, where two very different scenes flourished. On the West Coast, **Los Angeles’ Sunset Strip** nurtured flamboyant **glam metal** (also called hair metal), while **Northern California’s Bay Area** bred the opposite: raw, whiplash-fast **thrash metal**. By mid-decade, this polarization defined metal’s landscape. **Glam metal** became massively popular – bands like **Mötley Crüe**, **Poison**, **Ratt**, **Bon Jovi**, and **Whitesnake** dominated radio and MTV with party anthems, big hair, makeup, and decadent theatrics. Their music, rooted in 1970s hard rock and KISS-style glam, emphasized hooky choruses, melodic guitar solos, and sexy, fun-loving imagery (e.g. Mötley Crüe’s *Shout at the Devil* (1983) and Poison’s *Open Up and Say… Ahh!* (1988)). The typical glam metal song was mid-tempo, bluesy at its core but simplified and polished for mass appeal – often with romantic or hedonistic lyrics rather than occult or political themes. In sharp contrast, the **underground scenes** in the U.S. and Europe produced more **aggressive styles**: **thrash metal** burst forth with breakneck speed and scathing intensity, bringing heavy metal back to a state of *pure, unfiltered aggression*.

**Thrash Metal:** Thrash emerged in the **early 1980s** as a reaction against the perceived commercialism of mainstream metal. It was directly inspired by the **NWOBHM’s fast riffs** and the **DIY ferocity of hardcore punk**. Musically, thrash metal is defined by **extremely fast tempos** (often 180–220+ BPM), **palm-muted low-register guitar riffs** played with precision, “scooped” midrange guitar tone for a biting sound, and **double-bass drum** onslaughts. Songs featured frequent tempo changes, whiplash **galloping rhythms**, and virtuosic guitar solos – preserving metal’s love of skillful lead playing even amid the chaos. Vocals in thrash were usually shouted or barked in an aggressive tone (as opposed to the high wails of classic metal), matching the *confrontational* lyrical content. Indeed, thrash lyrics often addressed **societal issues, war, apocalypse, and corruption**, reflecting Cold War era anxieties and youthful disillusionment in the 1980s. The genre’s **epicenter** was the **San Francisco Bay Area**, where bands like **Metallica**, **Slayer** (though LA-based, closely tied to the Bay scene), **Megadeth** (founded in LA by a former Metallica member) and **Anthrax** (from New York, representing the East Coast) formed the “Big Four” of thrash. Bay Area thrash gigs fostered a notorious **moshing** culture – frenzied slam-dancing and stage-diving that thrash adopted from the hardcore punk scene. By the mid ’80s, thrash had *evolved out of the underground*: Metallica’s landmark album ***Master of Puppets* (1986)** became the genre’s first Platinum record and even cracked the mainstream Billboard top 40 with virtually no radio play. Slayer’s ***Reign in Blood* (1986)**, though too extreme for commercial radio, achieved legendary status for its blinding speed (ten songs in 29 minutes) and graphic themes. Other influential thrash albums include ***Peace Sells…* (1986)** by Megadeth and ***Among the Living* (1987)** by Anthrax, each pushing technical skill and social commentary. Beyond the U.S., thrash also thrived in **Germany** (**Kreator**, **Sodom**, **Destruction** – often called “Teutonic thrash”) and **Brazil** (e.g. **Sepultura**, whose early albums in the late ’80s were raw thrash/death metal). Thrash’s legacy was enormous: it not only carried metal’s torch in the ’80s underground, but also **directly spawned the extreme subgenres** of the late ’80s and ’90s. As MTV News later noted, *“Slayer’s music was directly responsible for the rise of death metal”* – meaning thrash’s speed and severity set the stage for even more radical developments. By 1989, bands like Metallica and Megadeth had refined thrash into a slightly more polished form (Metallica’s *…And Justice for All* (1988) even yielded a radio hit with “One”), but pure thrash remained primarily a **subcultural phenomenon** – cherished by dedicated metalheads even as other metal styles grabbed bigger spotlights.

**Rise of Extreme Metal:** Thrash opened the floodgates for **extreme metal**, and by the late 1980s two new subgenres – **death metal** and **black metal** – were gestating in the underground. **Death Metal** took thrash’s most aggressive aspects to new extremes: *even faster tempos*, heavier downtuned guitars, and a vocal style consisting of deep, guttural “death growls” instead of shouts or singing. Where thrash lyrics were dark, death metal’s were outright *morbid* – obsessed with death, gore, and horror. The prototype was **Venom** (UK), often considered part of the early “first wave” of black metal, but musically Venom’s 1981–82 work (*Welcome to Hell*, *Black Metal*) was a raw, simplified thrash with evil imagery that influenced both future death and black metal. The first true death metal bands coalesced by the mid/late ’80s: **Death** (from Florida, led by Chuck Schuldiner) released ***Scream Bloody Gore* (1987)**, blending Slayer-esque speed with horror-movie lyricism – widely regarded as a genre-defining album. In the **Florida scene** around Tampa, bands like **Morbid Angel**, **Obituary**, **Deicide**, and **Cannibal Corpse** followed, making Florida a *hotspot* dubbed “Death Metal Capital”. Meanwhile, the **UK’s grindcore scene** (led by **Napalm Death** and **Carcass**) – an extreme offshoot of anarcho-punk – also emerged in the late ’80s, characterized by even shorter, faster songs and grotesque imagery. Grindcore’s **blast beats** (ultrafast drumming) and guttural vocals overlapped with death metal; in fact, early Carcass and Napalm Death are often cited as both grindcore and formative death metal. Musically, late ’80s death metal riffs owed as much to *Black Sabbath’s* slow, “lumbering” doom sections as to thrash – alternating frantic speed with crushing, slow breakdowns. By 1989, **death metal** had a solid identity, though it remained **deep underground**, spread through tape trading and niche labels (e.g. Earache Records in the UK, Combat Records in the US). **Black Metal** in the 1980s was in an embryonic “first wave” state: bands like **Bathory** (Sweden), **Hellhammer/Celtic Frost** (Switzerland), **Mercyful Fate** (Denmark), and **Venom** (UK) each contributed elements that would define black metal. Common threads were *lo-fi production*, occult or Satanic themes, **shrieked vocals**, and an ethos of sinister mystique. Bathory’s early albums (1984–87) in particular featured the **high-pitched screams, tremolo-picked riffs, and droning minor-key melodies** that laid the groundwork for the “second wave” of black metal to erupt in the early ’90s. By the late ’80s, **Norway’s** nascent scene (bands like **Mayhem** formed in 1984) was taking shape, but it would be the next decade before black metal truly proliferated. Thus, at the close of the 1980s, extreme metal was still mostly a **word-of-mouth underground**, with death and black metal **fanzines, demo tapes, and small club scenes** sowing the seeds for the 1990s.

**Mainstream and Pop Metal:** In contrast to the thrashers and death metal mutants thriving in the shadows, the *mainstream face of metal in the ’80s was epitomized by glam metal*. Often derided by purists but undeniably successful, **glam metal** (or **hair metal**) brought heavy metal aesthetics to MTV and Top 40 radio. Musically, glam metal drew from **’70s glam rock and hard rock** (influences like Sweet, Aerosmith, Van Halen, and Kiss) and added a **pop songwriting sensibility**: big hooks, sing-along choruses, and radio-friendly sheen. Songs typically sat in a **moderate tempo** range (around 100–130 BPM), with **major-key or bluesy riffs**, flashy guitar solos (inspired by Eddie Van Halen’s virtuosic tapping technique), and conventional verse-chorus structures. While thrash bands wore jeans and leather, glam bands donned spandex, makeup, and hairspray – projecting an image of excess and wild partying. **Los Angeles** was the breeding ground for this scene; clubs on the Sunset Strip (like the Whisky a Go Go and Roxy) hosted bands such as **Mötley Crüe** (debut *Too Fast for Love* 1981), **Ratt** (*Out of the Cellar* 1984), **Poison** (*Look What the Cat Dragged In* 1986), and **Guns N’ Roses** (whose 1987 *Appetite for Destruction* – though more gritty hard rock than “hair metal” per se – became one of the best-selling debut albums ever). By the late ’80s, even traditionally metal bands toned down their heaviness for commercial success: **Whitesnake**, originally a blues-rock act, scored a #1 hit with the power ballad “Here I Go Again” (1987); **Def Leppard**’s glossy *Hysteria* album (1987) sold 20+ million copies worldwide, loaded with polished anthems. Lyrically, glam metal was mostly about **girls, partying, and empowerment**, in stark contrast to the apocalyptic or occult themes of extreme metal. The subgenre also produced the quintessential ’80s *power ballad* – emotional slow-tempo songs with clean guitars and bombastic crescendos (e.g. Mötley Crüe’s “Home Sweet Home”, Poison’s “Every Rose Has Its Thorn”). **Sociocultural context:** The popularity of glam metal in the ’80s was fueled by **MTV** (launched 1981), which gave heavy rotation to flamboyant videos, and by a youth culture embracing flashy, rebellious fun during the Reagan/Cold War era. Yet, glam’s hedonism also sparked backlash: conservative groups (like the PMRC in 1985) accused metal of corrupting youth, slapping “Parental Advisory” labels on albums for explicit content – which only bolstered metal’s anti-authority appeal. By decade’s end, the glam metal formula was wearing thin due to over-saturation and changing tastes, setting the stage for a dramatic shift in the 1990s.

**Other Notable 1980s Developments:** Amid the big two (thrash vs. glam), several other metal subgenres took root. **Speed Metal**, closely tied to thrash, referred to bands that played **very fast and technical** yet retained more melodic vocals and cleaner execution than thrash’s gritty approach. Early ’80s **Accept** (Germany) and **Anvil** (Canada) are examples, and indeed **Helloween’s** first albums (’85–’87) could be called speed metal before they evolved into… **Power Metal**, which coalesced in the late ’80s largely as a *melodic backlash to extreme metal’s harshness*. **Power metal** (especially in Europe) took the uptempo energy of speed metal and combined it with **NWOBHM’s epic, soaring melodies and high clean vocals**, plus frequent inspiration from classical music and fantasy themes. Germany’s **Helloween** led the way with their ***Keeper of the Seven Keys* (1987–88)** albums, which “crystallized the sonic ingredients” of power metal – twin guitars harmonizing melodically, fast double-bass drumming, and “high-pitched, clean singing” in the vein of Iron Maiden and Judas Priest. Power metal focused on **uplifting, epic themes** (battles, mythology, fantasy adventures) appealing to a sense of valor and escapism, essentially the opposite of death/black metal’s darkness. By ’88–’89, power metal was particularly strong in Germany (e.g. **Running Wild**, **Blind Guardian**) and began spreading to Scandinavia and beyond – though in North America it remained more underground. **Doom Metal** also saw a revival: inspired directly by Black Sabbath’s slow, heavy sound, bands like **Saint Vitus** (California), **Trouble** (Chicago), **Pentagram** (resurrected in the ’80s from ’70s roots in D.C.), and Sweden’s **Candlemass** (whose 1986 *Epicus Doomicus Metallicus* gave *epic doom* a formal identity) all deliberately **slowed metal to a crawl**. Doom metal of the ’80s emphasized crushing **slow riffs, melancholic or occult moods, and clean or wailing vocals** (Candlemass’s Messiah Marcolin famously sang in operatic tones). This was a conscious rejection of the speed obsession – *“doom” bands traced their roots to early Sabbath in both music and gloomy lyrics*. By 1989, doom’s influence was branching into hybrids (for example, the **Melvins** from Seattle fused doom with punk dissonance, laying groundwork for sludge and grunge). The late ’80s also introduced **crossover thrash** (bands like **D.R.I.**, **Suicidal Tendencies**, **Stormtroopers of Death** blending thrash metal and hardcore punk in short, mosh-friendly bursts) and **industrial metal**, pioneered by artists like **Ministry** (who transitioned from synth-pop to a brutal industrial-thrash metal by *The Land of Rape and Honey* (1988)) and **Godflesh** (UK, whose 1989 *Streetcleaner* mated heavy metal riffs with mechanical drum-machine beats). These fusions presaged whole new scenes in the ’90s.

**Key Albums & Bands (1980s):** *Iron Maiden’s* ***The Number of the Beast* (1982)** – a NWOBHM milestone that influenced countless bands with its galloping bass, twin guitars and theatrical scope. *Metallica’s* ***Master of Puppets* (1986)** – oft-cited as one of the greatest metal albums, it brought thrash’s complexity to mainstream attention. *Slayer’s* ***Reign in Blood* (1986)** set the bar for speed and extremity in the 80s (its opening track “Angel of Death” remains a benchmark of thrash intensity). On the glam side, *Bon Jovi’s* ***Slippery When Wet* (1986)** and *Guns N’ Roses’* ***Appetite for Destruction* (1987)** were multi-platinum blockbusters that proved metal (in its broader sense) could rule the charts. In the extreme underground, *Death’s* ***Scream Bloody Gore* (1987)** and *Morbid Angel’s* ***Altars of Madness* (1989)** became foundational death metal texts, while *Bathory’s* ***Under the Sign of the Black Mark* (1987)** and *Mayhem’s* early demos (later compiled) galvanized the coming black metal hordes. *Helloween’s* ***Keeper of the Seven Keys Part II* (1988)** defined European power metal’s legacy. And bridging genres, *Sepultura’s* ***Beneath the Remains* (1989)** showed thrash’s global reach (Brazil) and hinted at the death metal leanings that band would explore in the ’90s. By 1990, heavy metal was at a commercial peak but also at a **stylistic crossroads**: the flashy excess of glam was about to be dethroned by a very different “alternative” aesthetic, while the groundwork laid by thrash and extreme metal in the ’80s was set to blossom further underground. **Legacy of the ’80s:** This decade cemented metal’s **multi-headed identity** – from pop-friendly anthems to underground extremity – a duality that persists today. The Big Four thrash bands became major influences on almost every metal subgenre after (thrash being the common ancestor of groove, death, black, etc.), and many are still active headliners. The **stage theatrics and image** pioneered by ’80s glam/hair bands influenced later visual-focused genres and the idea of metal “showmanship” (even as grunge temporarily knocked it down). Perhaps most significantly, the late ’80s gave us the **first generation of extreme metal heroes** (Death, Bathory, etc.), who would directly inspire the flood of death/black metal in the ’90s. It was truly a golden age – commercially and creatively – whose riffs and ideas are still being reinterpreted by metal bands well into the 21st century.

## 1990s: Into the Extreme – Grunge Shakeup, Death/Black Flourish, and New Hybrid Genres

The 1990s were a tumultuous yet richly creative decade for heavy metal. The decade opened with a sudden shift in mainstream tastes: the **explosion of grunge and alternative rock** (led by Nirvana’s *Nevermind* in 1991) effectively **ended the reign of ’80s glam metal** almost overnight. As flannel-clad bands from Seattle took over radio, metal’s most commercial subgenre collapsed – *“the popular breakthrough of grunge… \[made] metal seem dead in the dull eyes of the mainstream”*. However, metal itself was far from dead; it was **mutating and diversifying**. While the mainstream music press pivoted to alternative rock, metal artists responded in two ways: some *adapted* to the new climate, incorporating alternative influences, and others went further *underground*, doubling down on extremity. The early ’90s thus saw the **peak of death metal and black metal in the underground**, the rise of **groove metal and alternative metal** in the midpoint, and by the late ’90s, the emergence of a new mainstream wave via **nu metal** – a hybrid genre mixing metal with hip-hop and alternative elements.

**Death Metal Breaks Out (Early ’90s):** After gestating in the ’80s, **death metal** came of age in the early 1990s. Florida’s scene was on fire – *Morbid Angel’s* ***Blessed Are the Sick* (1991)** and *Deicide’s* ***Legion* (1992)** upped the ante with technical riffs and blasphemous themes, while *Cannibal Corpse* gained notoriety (and censorship in some countries) for gore-soaked album art and lyrics (*Tomb of the Mutilated* (1992) featured the infamous “Hammer Smashed Face”). In the **U.K., the grindcore-death hybrid** produced standout albums like *Carcass’* ***Heartwork* (1993)**, which helped pioneer **melodic death metal** with its blend of harsh vocals and NWOBHM-style guitar harmonies. The **Swedish death metal** scene also rose to prominence with two distinct flavors: the **Stockholm sound** – exemplified by *Entombed’s* ***Left Hand Path* (1990)** and *Dismember’s* ***Like an Ever Flowing Stream* (1991)** – had a signature **“buzzsaw” guitar tone** (achieved via the Boss HM-2 pedal) and a raw, punky aggression. Meanwhile, on Sweden’s west coast, **Gothenburg** gave birth to **melodic death metal** (melodeath), with bands like **At The Gates**, **In Flames**, and **Dark Tranquillity** infusing death metal with twin-guitar melodies and the spirit of Iron Maiden. *At The Gates’* ***Slaughter of the Soul* (1995)** became a melodeath classic that would later heavily influence American metalcore. Musically, ’90s death metal was typically played in **drop tunings (C, B or lower)** for a heavier crunch, with **blast beat** drumming and complex song structures (some bands embraced progressive complexity, e.g. **Death** moved toward technical/progressive death metal on *Human* (1991) and *Symbolic* (1995)). Vocals remained mostly **deep growls or roars**, though a few bands like **Carcass** and **Obituary** used slightly higher “retching” growls. Lyrical themes broadened: beyond gore, death metal tackled anti-religion, philosophy (Death’s later albums), and socio-political commentary (Napalm Death’s Barney Greenway roared about injustice). Despite minimal mainstream exposure, death metal maintained a **dedicated global cult following** – a *“small, dedicated cult”* that found this extreme style a preferable alternative to the mainstream rock of the time. Key geographic pockets included **Tampa, Florida** (Morrisound Recording studio was ground zero), **New York** (NYDM scene: Suffocation, Immolation, etc.), **Stockholm/Gothenburg, Sweden**, the **UK’s Midlands** (Earache Records in Nottingham), and later **Brazil** (e.g. **Sepultura** pivoted to death/thrash on *Arise* (1991) and groove/death on *Chaos A.D.* (1993)). By the mid-’90s, death metal’s initial boom slightly receded (some U.S. labels dropped extreme bands as sales plateaued), but the genre persisted and evolved (e.g. the late ’90s saw the birth of ultra-technical “brutal” death metal and fusion genres like **death/doom**, **blackened death**, etc., often on smaller independent labels).

**Black Metal’s Second Wave:** In the early ’90s, **black metal** truly erupted as a genre of its own, led by the infamous Norwegian scene. The **second wave of black metal** (circa 1990–1994) was heralded by albums such as *Mayhem’s* ***De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas* (1994)**, **Darkthrone**’s ***A Blaze in the Northern Sky* (1992)**, **Immortal**’s ***Pure Holocaust* (1993)**, and **Burzum**’s early works. These bands defined black metal’s core sound: **blast beat drumming**, **tremolo-picked riffs** creating a droning “wall of sound,” **high-pitched shrieking vocals**, and deliberately **lo-fi production** to maximize a cold, grim atmosphere. The guitar tone was thin and razor-sharp compared to the thick crunch of death metal; melody often came in the form of eerie, minor-key chord progressions rather than solos. Black metal lyrics and imagery were overtly **Satanic, anti-Christian, and steeped in pagan or occult mysticism**. Many bands also drew on **ancient paganism and folklore** (e.g. **Enslaved** mixed Norse mythology, **Satyricon** and **Emperor** incorporated medieval/folk elements), giving the genre a proud *anti-modern, anti-Christian cultural stance*. The scene’s **geographic heart** was **Norway** (especially around Oslo and Bergen) – and there, black metal infamously intertwined with real-life violence. Members of the scene were involved in a spree of **church burnings** (dozens of historic wooden stave churches were torched in Norway between 1992–1996) and even **murder** (Mayhem’s guitarist Euronymous was killed by Burzum’s Varg Vikernes in 1993). This brought intense media attention to black metal, making it a notorious cause célèbre in the mid-’90s. Ethos-wise, the Norwegian black metallers positioned themselves in opposition to commercialization – they saw death metal becoming too popular and *“commercialized”*, and deliberately made black metal insular and hostile to outsiders. As one member put it, *“It had to do with production, lyrics, the way they dressed – a commitment to making ugly, raw, grim stuff. There wasn’t a generic sound”*. Indeed, early ’90s black metal had a unique ethos of **elitism and evil-as-art**, which appealed strongly to disaffected youth in Scandinavia and later worldwide. By 1992–93, **black metal scenes** (or at least passionate fanbases) had begun cropping up outside Norway – in Sweden (e.g. **Dissection**, **Marduk**), Poland (**Behemoth**’s early work), Germany, France, etc.. In the mid/late ’90s, some key bands split up or changed style (Burzum veered into ambient music while Varg was in prison; Darkthrone went lo-fi punk; Mayhem reformed later), and a few **symphonic/keyboard-laden black metal** acts emerged (e.g. **Emperor** added grandiose keyboards on *In the Nightside Eclipse* (1994); **Dimmu Borgir** and **Cradle of Filth** incorporated gothic symphonies), which by the late ’90s brought black metal a bit closer to mainstream metal. *Dimmu Borgir’s* albums in 1997–2001 and *Cradle of Filth’s* gothic horror-metal (though purists debate if CoF is “true” black metal) gained large followings and even charted, introducing a more accessible form of black metal to new listeners. Meanwhile, **Viking metal** and **folk metal** branched off from black metal’s pagan interests – for instance, Sweden’s **Bathory** had by 1990 shifted from satanic black metal to epic Viking-themed metal, influencing bands like **Enslaved** and **Moonsorrow**, and **Skyclad** (UK) pioneered folk metal by adding fiddles to thrashy riffing in 1991. By the end of the ’90s, black metal had firmly established itself as a major branch of metal (even if its fanbase was smaller than death metal’s), with a vast network of underground labels (Moonfog, Osmose, Century Media, etc.) distributing the music globally.

**Thrash Evolves into Groove (and gets overshadowed):** Traditional thrash metal struggled in the 1990s. The “Big Four” thrash bands each took different paths: Metallica’s 1991 self-titled “Black Album” slowed down to a **groove-oriented, standard heavy metal** style – and became one of the decade’s biggest rock albums. Songs like “Enter Sandman” abandoned thrash complexity for simple, hooky riffs, bringing Metallica massive mainstream success but alienating some thrash diehards. By 1994, Metallica, Megadeth (*Countdown to Extinction*, 1992) and Anthrax had all drifted toward a more accessible heavy metal sound (or even alternative elements), leaving **Pantera** to carry the torch for American heavy metal’s aggression. **Pantera**, a Texas band that had actually started as a glam act in the ’80s, reinvented themselves with 1990’s ***Cowboys from Hell***, introducing a **groove metal** style: essentially thrash metal’s heaviness and precision *slowed down* into a muscular groove, with hardcore-influenced breakdowns and an extra dose of Southern swagger. Pantera’s riffmaster Dimebag Darrell specialized in **down-tuned, syncopated riffs** (often in *D* or *C#* standard tuning) that were headbang-friendly and **groovy** – tracks like “Walk” (92 BPM of pure stomp) and “Domination” set the template. Vocalist Phil Anselmo combined harsh screams with aggressive “tough-guy” shouted vocals, reflecting New York hardcore influences. Pantera’s ***Vulgar Display of Power* (1992)** and ***Far Beyond Driven* (1994)** were landmark releases – *Far Beyond Driven* even debuted at #1 on Billboard, a remarkable achievement for such a brutally heavy record. Pantera’s success, along with that of fellow groove/thrash acts like **Sepultura** (Brazilian band whose *Chaos A.D.* (1993) slowed their earlier thrash into tribal-groove anthems) and **White Zombie** (*La Sexorcisto*, 1992, mixing groove metal with psych-horror vibes), signaled that aggressive metal still had an audience even as grunge dominated the media. This **post-thrash “groove metal”** movement (sometimes dubbed the *“new wave of American heavy metal”* in retrospect) was a key link between ’80s thrash and the emerging metal styles of the late ’90s. It provided a more rhythmic, accessible heaviness that influenced the upcoming nu metal generation. At the same time, many ’80s thrash bands in the ’90s either split up or experimented with new sounds. By 1996, thrash as a genre was largely underground again, though a few bands (Testament, Overkill, etc.) soldiered on and would experience a revival in the 2000s.

**Alternative Metal and Crossover (Early/Mid ’90s):** One of the decade’s defining trends was **genre fusion** – metal combined with alternative rock, funk, hip-hop, industrial, and more, creating an umbrella of **alternative metal** in the early ’90s. *Alternative metal* isn’t a single style so much as a category for bands that didn’t fit traditional metal subgenres. Key groups included **Faith No More**, whose 1989 hit “Epic” merged metal riffing with funk-style bass and even rap-like vocals, and **Jane’s Addiction**, who mixed hard rock with alternative psychedelia. **Tool**, emerging with *Undertow* (1993), blended metal’s heaviness with **progressive rock** complexity and introspective, abstract lyrics. **Soundgarden** and **Alice in Chains**, two Seattle bands often labeled “grunge,” in fact had strong heavy metal lineage – Soundgarden’s music channeled Sabbath and Led Zeppelin through a sludgy, detuned filter, helping *“make a place for heavy metal in alternative rock”*. Alice in Chains likewise combined metal riffs with dark, harmonized vocals and became one of the early ’90s biggest acts (their 1992 album *Dirt* is essentially doom-y heavy metal with grunge aesthetics). Meanwhile, **industrial metal** came to prominence: **Ministry**’s *Psalm 69* (1992) and **Nine Inch Nails**’ *Broken* EP (1992) injected distorted guitars into electronic industrial beats, and bands like **Fear Factory** (L.A.) fused extreme metal with machine-like **industrial** rhythms (1995’s *Demanufacture* features synchronized riff-and-drum patterns with cyberpunk themes). **Marilyn Manson**, a protégé of NIN, adopted Alice Cooper’s shock-rock theatrics over industrial-metal instrumentation on *Antichrist Superstar* (1996), sparking controversy and wide popularity. **Rap metal** also gained a foothold: building on precedents like Anthrax’s rap-influenced songs and *Run-D.M.C. & Aerosmith’s* 1986 collab, bands such as **Rage Against The Machine** (debut in 1992) combined **hip-hop vocals and funk-rock grooves with metal guitar** – RATM’s Tom Morello even used guitar effects to emulate DJ scratching. By the mid-’90s, the term *“alternative metal”* encompassed all these eclectic fusions. These bands were united less by sound than by an **experimental ethos**: they *“mixed metal with different styles and rejected glam metal aesthetics”*. The result was some of the decade’s most innovative music. Many found mainstream success too – e.g. Tool’s *Ænima* (1996) went platinum, White Zombie and Marilyn Manson were all over MTV, and **Primus** (who melded funk, metal, and quirky humor) had a cult following. This cross-pollination demonstrated “the colorful results of metal opening up to face the outside world”. It also laid the groundwork for **nu metal** at the decade’s end, by proving that metal could absorb diverse influences and still appeal to a young audience craving something fresh.

**Doom, Gothic, and Other ’90s Currents:** In the early ’90s U.K., a trio of bands – **Paradise Lost**, **My Dying Bride**, and **Anathema** – combined doom’s slow, mournful sound with death metal vocals, pioneering a **death/doom** style. Paradise Lost’s ***Gothic* (1991)** introduced atmospheric keyboards and female vocals alongside death growls, basically creating **gothic metal**. By the mid-’90s, these bands had evolved to clean vocals and more gothic rock influences, influencing European gothic metal with its “beauty and the beast” dual-vocal approach (beauty = clean female singing, beast = male growls) – e.g. **Theatre of Tragedy** (Norway) and later **Tristania** did this. *Type O Negative* from Brooklyn also merged **doom metal with gothic sensibilities**, releasing slow, sardonic dirges with deep clean vocals (Peter Steele) and vampiric imagery (*Bloody Kisses*, 1993, was a breakthrough). In the U.S., the **sludge metal** genre, which had started in the late ’80s, gained recognition in the ’90s with **Eyehategod** and **Crowbar** out of New Orleans blending **doom tempos with hardcore punk aggression**. Their Louisiana scene gave sludge a notorious reputation for gritty, alcohol-and-misery-soaked heaviness. From sludge came **stoner metal/rock**, as bands like **Kyuss** (from the California desert) and **Sleep** (San Jose) took Sabbath-style riffs and added hazy psychedelic vibes – Kyuss’s *Blues for the Red Sun* (1992) and Sleep’s *Holy Mountain* (1993) were foundational stoner metal records. At the extreme end of doom, **drone metal** emerged: Seattle’s **Earth** (led by Dylan Carlson) and later **Sunn O)))** (formed 1998) created ultra-slow, minimalistic walls of amplifier feedback, described as sounding like *“an Indian raga in the middle of an earthquake”*. By decade’s close, one could find a metal subgenre to suit nearly any mood – from the **romantic gloom** of gothic metal to the **feral violence** of black metal, the **urban rage** of industrial and groove metal, or the **cosmic haze** of stoner and drone. Metal had diversified hugely, even as it temporarily lost some mainstream visibility.

**Nu Metal and a New Mainstream (Late ’90s):** Toward the end of the ’90s, a new generation of American bands blended all these threads – the weight of groove metal, the experimentalism of alt-metal, the energy of hip-hop – into a style that would return heavy guitars to radio and MTV. Dubbed **nu metal**, these bands generally down-tuned their guitars (often to *Drop D or lower*), stripped away guitar solos, and incorporated elements like **rap vocals, turntables/DJs, funk-style bass slaps, and electronic beats**. The result was a rhythmic, hook-filled, accessible form of metal that resonated with late ’90s youth. **Korn** (from Bakersfield, CA) is often credited with kickstarting nu metal – their debut ***Korn* (1994)** introduced angsty, rapped/spoken verses by Jonathan Davis, heavy 7-string guitar riffs, and a hip-hop meets metal vibe that was utterly new. Korn’s follow-ups and relentless touring built a dedicated following. By the late ’90s, numerous nu metal acts broke big: **Deftones** (Sacramento) melded atmospheric shoegaze elements with punishing riffs on *Around the Fur* (1997), **Limp Bizkit** (Florida) brought a brash rap-core approach (and scored a string of MTV hits like “Nookie”), **Papa Roach** and **P.O.D.** blended rap with hard rock anthems, and **Slipknot** (Iowa) took a more extreme route – a nine-member masked outfit that combined pummeling percussion, DJ scratches, and a mix of rapped and screamed vocals. **Linkin Park** from L.A. perfected a pop-friendly variant with dual vocalists (singer Chester Bennington and rapper Mike Shinoda) on their mega-selling ***Hybrid Theory* (2000)**, though that album actually dropped right at the decade’s turn. Nu metal’s lyrical themes were **intensely personal and emotional** – focusing on childhood trauma, alienation, inner turmoil – which connected with fans on a visceral level. By 1998–99, nu metal was **all over mainstream rock media**. Tours like **Ozzfest** (launched by Ozzy Osbourne in 1996) showcased these new bands alongside veteran metal acts, signaling a “resurgence of heavy metal” in popular culture. In 1999, *Billboard* noted there were over 500 metal-oriented radio shows in the U.S., triple the number a decade earlier – evidence of metal’s comeback via nu metal’s popularity. However, the success came with a split in the metal community: traditional metal fans often *did not fully embrace* nu metal’s style or its lack of classic virtuosic musicianship. Some derided it as “mallcore.” Nonetheless, for a brief period around 1999–2001, bands like Korn, Limp Bizkit, and Slipknot were among the biggest rock acts worldwide, bringing aggressively down-tuned riffs and screaming back to the charts. Nu metal demonstrated that **“pancultural metal could pay off”**, as one critic put it – it fused genres and attracted a diverse fanbase.

By the early 2000s, the nu metal wave had started to wane (critics and fans grew weary of its formulas by 2002–2003, and many bands either evolved or lost prominence). But nu metal’s influence on what came next – particularly the metalcore and mainstream metal of the 2000s – was significant.

**Legacy of the 1990s:** The 1990s fundamentally reshaped heavy metal’s landscape. The decade’s **extreme metal innovations** (death, black, grind) would continue to thrive in the underground and inspire new subgenres (e.g. symphonic black metal, melodic death metal leading to metalcore, etc.). The **cultural impact** of the Norwegian black metal scene – its anti-establishment philosophy and haunting aesthetic – gave metal a new mythos and attracted academic interest in metal as a subculture of transgression. Meanwhile, the **groove metal and alternative/nu-metal trends** kept heavy music relevant to a new generation, even as traditional metal receded from radio; these styles diversified metal’s palette by incorporating hip-hop, industrial, and funk influences, arguably making metal more open-ended and experimental. Metal in the ’90s also went truly **global**: scenes emerged or grew in places like Brazil (Sepultura put South America on the metal map), Scandinavia (Finland’s love of metal soared, Norway/Sweden became extreme metal meccas), and even parts of Asia and the Middle East (e.g. Israel’s **Orphaned Land** fused death metal with Middle Eastern folk from 1994 onward). By 2000, heavy metal was a far broader church than it had been in 1990 – spanning the most commercial rap-rock to the most obscure ambient drone. This set the stage for the **fragmentation and fusion** that defined the 2000s, and for the resurgence of some traditional styles with a new twist in the new millennium.

## 2000s: New Millennium – Metalcore, Revivals, and Globalization

In the 2000s, heavy metal entered the 21st century both **reinvigorated and deeply fragmented** into subgenres. After the late ’90s nu metal boom, metal fans saw a renaissance of heavier styles in the 2000s: **metalcore** and **deathcore** brought hardcore-punk energy into metal, classic genres like **thrash and traditional heavy metal saw revivals**, and metal became more international than ever. The 2000s also witnessed the rise of a new generation of festival-headlining metal bands – sometimes referred to as the **“New Wave of American Heavy Metal (NWOAHM)”** – which encompassed a variety of styles (from metalcore to groove/thrash revival). Crucially, the 2000s were the decade where the **internet and digital technology** reshaped music consumption and community. Metal, with its passionate fanbase, adapted quickly: online forums, webzines, and later social media/MySpace were instrumental in spreading new bands worldwide. By mid-decade, many began speaking of a **metal resurgence**: extreme bands were topping independent charts, legacy bands were finding new audiences, and metal subculture was thriving on a global scale. According to cultural studies, *Scandinavia and Northern Europe emerged as especially metal-friendly markets* – Finland, for example, was dubbed “the *Promised Land of Heavy Metal*” with the world’s highest number of metal bands per capita (50+ per 100,000 people). Metal’s center of gravity was no longer just the Anglo-American sphere; it had truly become *global music* by the 2000s.

**Metalcore: The New Force (Mid-2000s):** One of the biggest movements of the 2000s was the rise of **metalcore** – a hybrid genre that combined **extreme metal riffing (especially melodic death metal) with hardcore punk’s breakdowns and intensity**. Metalcore had underground origins in the ’90s (with bands like Earth Crisis, Converge, Integrity), but it **broke into the mainstream mid-2000s**. Hallmarks of metalcore include *dual guitar harmonies borrowed from Gothenburg melodeath, heavy chugging breakdowns* (slow, rhythmic sections for moshing), *switching between harsh screamed vocals and clean, anthemic choruses* (particularly in the **melodic metalcore** variant), and lyrics often dealing with personal struggle, society, or relationships (in contrast to the fantasy or gore of traditional metal). The scene’s early pioneers, per historians, include **Earth Crisis** and **Converge** in the ’90s U.S. hardcore scene, but the breakthrough came with bands like **Killswitch Engage**, **Shadows Fall**, **As I Lay Dying**, **Unearth**, **Trivium**, and **Avenged Sevenfold** in the early 2000s. The **New England region (Massachusetts)** was a hotbed – Killswitch Engage’s ***Alive or Just Breathing* (2002)** fused Swedish-style melodic riffs with hardcore intensity and set the template for modern metalcore. By 2004, *Killswitch Engage’s* ***The End of Heartache*** and *Shadows Fall’s* ***The War Within*** debuted in the **Billboard Top 20 albums** – a remarkable feat for such aggressive music, signaling metalcore’s **commercial ascent**. On the West Coast, **Atreyu** and **Avenged Sevenfold** (Orange County, CA) incorporated more rock/metal influences (and in A7X’s case, eventually transitioned to a more classic metal sound entirely). The **Warped Tour** and **Ozzfest** festivals in the mid-2000s often featured metalcore bands, further boosting their profile. Musically, metalcore guitarists used a mix of **thrash-like fast riffs, melodeath-style harmonized leads, and brutal breakdown riffs** with heavily palm-muted open strings. Drummers combined punk beats, double-bass runs, and breakdown-friendly half-time rhythms. Vocals were typically **screamed shouts** (influenced by hardcore punk delivery) with **occasional clean singing**, especially in choruses (in melodic metalcore acts like Killswitch, clean singer Howard Jones balanced screams with soaring vocal hooks). This dual approach broadened the appeal to fans of both heavy and melodic music. Lyrically, many metalcore songs addressed introspective and social topics, reflective of hardcore’s message-oriented roots. A notable offshoot was **Christian metalcore**, with bands like **Underoath** and **As I Lay Dying** achieving popularity while espousing faith-based themes – showing the genre’s diversity of viewpoints. By the late 2000s, metalcore was arguably the dominant form of new heavy music in North America, with some bands achieving Gold album sales and Grammy nominations (e.g. Killswitch Engage).

**Deathcore and Extreme Fusions:** Building on metalcore’s framework, the late 2000s saw the emergence of **deathcore** – essentially **metalcore fused with death metal** in terms of riff style and extremity. Deathcore features *down-tuned, often 7 or 8-string guitars delivering crushing death metal riffs and squealing pinch harmonics*, alongside *hardcore-style breakdowns that are even slower and heavier (often the infamous “bass drop” breakdowns)*. Vocals are a mix of death metal **growls, high-pitched screams, and distinctive “pig squeal” gutturals**. Lyrics tend toward typical death metal brutality or nihilism, though some bands lean into ironic or horror themes. This style gained prominence via bands like **Whitechapel**, **Suicide Silence**, **Job for a Cowboy**, **Carnifex**, and **Despised Icon** in the mid-to-late 2000s. For example, *Suicide Silence’s* ***The Cleansing* (2007)** and *Whitechapel’s* ***This Is Exile* (2008)** are early deathcore milestones that charted on the Billboard 200 – an impressive crossover for such extreme content. Deathcore initially found its audience largely through **MySpace and internet forums** – these bands skillfully utilized social media to reach kids globally (Job for a Cowboy famously got huge online before even releasing a full album). The genre solidified around the late 2000s and early 2010s, eventually headlining tours like **Summer Slaughter** (an extreme metal package tour). Other extreme hybrids in the 2000s included **grindcore’s revival** through bands like **Pig Destroyer** and **Nasum**, **tech death metal’s** rise (virtuosic, complex death metal from bands like **Necrophagist**, **Obscura**), and the first wave of **djent** (discussed below, though it truly boomed in the 2010s).

**Return of Traditional Styles:** Interestingly, even as new subgenres thrived, the 2000s also saw a renewed interest in *traditional and retro metal*. A crop of young bands celebrated old-school sounds, a trend media sometimes dubbed *“retro-metal”*. For instance, **The Sword** (Texas) and **Witchcraft** (Sweden) resurrected 1970s-style riff-rock/doom with obvious Black Sabbath influence. The Sword’s *Age of Winters* (2006) riffed straight out of the Sabbath/Pentagram playbook, while Witchcraft added touches of folk and psychedelia to their 70s doom homage. **Wolfmother** (Australia) had mainstream success with a heavy retro-rock style (their 2005 debut had *“Deep Purple-ish organs” and “Jimmy Page-worthy riffs”*). In the U.S., bands like **Mastodon** (Atlanta) gained acclaim by mixing a **sludge metal** foundation with **progressive** songwriting – their breakthrough *Leviathan* (2004) and *Blood Mountain* (2006) albums helped inspire talk of a *“metal revival”* in the U.S., sometimes tied to that so-called NWOAHM. Mastodon in particular showed that musically ambitious metal could find a broad audience again; by 2009 their album *Crack the Skye* (a prog-metal opus) hit the top 20. **Power metal** saw a golden period internationally in the 2000s: European power metal bands (many formed in the ’90s) like **Blind Guardian**, **HammerFall**, **Nightwish**, **Stratovarius**, **Rhapsody (of Fire)**, and **DragonForce** reached large audiences – the latter’s “Through the Fire and Flames” (2006) became famous via the video game *Guitar Hero*, exemplifying power metal’s speedy, virtuosic fun. **Symphonic metal**, often overlapping with power metal, also bloomed: Finland’s **Nightwish** and the Netherlands’ **Within Temptation** scored #1 albums in parts of Europe, blending metal guitars with orchestras and operatic vocals. This era also saw **female-fronted metal** become prominent (Sharon den Adel of Within Temptation, Tarja Turunen of Nightwish, Cristina Scabbia of **Lacuna Coil**), breaking some gender barriers in a historically male-dominated genre. On the extreme end, **black metal** continued strong – but notably, by the 2000s it had splintered into many sub-styles (e.g. **symphonic black metal** like Dimmu Borgir which hit #1 in Norway in 2007; **folk/Viking metal** like **Amon Amarth** or **Ensiferum** blending melodic death with Nordic themes; **depressive black metal**; etc.). **Norwegian-style black metal** became an influence on a surprising range of new music globally, and black metal bands from unexpected countries emerged (e.g. **Chthonic** from Taiwan mixing black metal with Asian instrumentation). In sum, the 2000s were an era of *both looking backward and forward* – many fans and artists rediscovered the roots of metal and brought them into the new millennium.

**Globalization & Technology:** The 2000s truly proved that heavy metal transcended borders. As mentioned, Northern Europe particularly embraced metal – by mid-decade, **Germany** had multiple homegrown metal bands hitting their Top 20 charts (Children of Bodom from Finland, Dimmu Borgir from Norway, Blind Guardian from Germany, HammerFall from Sweden all notched German top 20 albums in 2003–2008). **Finland**’s love for metal became a cultural talking point (Finnish bands like **Children of Bodom**, **Nightwish**, **HIM** became national best-sellers, and Finland won the 2006 Eurovision Song Contest with shock-rock/metal band **Lordi** – a truly mainstream moment for metal in Europe). Elsewhere, burgeoning scenes in **Latin America**, **East Asia**, and the Middle East showed the music’s reach. For example, **Angra** (Brazil) and **Sepultura** remained influential in South America; **Tang Dynasty** pioneered Chinese heavy metal; **India** saw a growing metal underground by late 2000s; and **Iran** and **Middle Eastern** metal bands (often in exile due to local restrictions) started to gain attention via the internet (captured in the 2008 documentary *Global Metal*). The **internet** and file-sharing (Napster, etc.) initially posed challenges to the record industry, but for metal they were a double-edged sword: while physical album sales dropped, metal fans used the net to discover obscure bands worldwide, and social platforms (MySpace in mid-2000s) allowed metal musicians to reach fans directly. A notable example is **Arsis** (a U.S. melodic tech-death band) who built a following through online forums and MP3s, or **Job for a Cowboy**, who famously leveraged MySpace to such success that their 2007 debut landed at #54 on Billboard. **Production technology** also advanced: home recording became feasible, and many metal artists embraced **triggered drums, amp simulators, and digital editing**, leading to a very *polished, precise production style* on many mid/late-2000s releases (especially in metalcore and tech-death). Some lamented this, but it enabled even underground bands to achieve big, clean sound.

**Cross-Pollination and Experiments:** The 2000s continued to brew new hybrid genres. **Metalcore** itself gave birth to offshoots: **mathcore**, exemplified by **The Dillinger Escape Plan**, incorporated dizzying time-signature changes and dissonance (comparable to free jazz in rhythmic complexity). **Electronicore** emerged as bands like **Enter Shikari**, **Attack Attack!** and **The Devil Wears Prada** integrated techno/trance synths and electronica into metalcore circa 2008–2010 – essentially foreshadowing EDM/metal blends of the 2010s. **Folk metal** grew into a sizable subculture in Europe: bands like **Korpiklaani** (Finland), **Eluveitie** (Switzerland) and **Finntroll** (Finland) drew big festival crowds with their mix of speedy metal and traditional folk instruments (fiddles, flutes, accordions) playing polkas and jigs. **Pirate metal** (Alestorm), **Celtic metal**, even **Mongolian folk-metal** (the band **The Hu** formed 2016, but as an example of where folk influences went) are all part of folk metal’s playful expansion – many of these got rolling in late 2000s. **Industrial and electronic music** continued to intermix with metal too: **Static-X** coined “industrial groove metal,” **Fear Factory** flirted with drum machines and trance remixes, and by late decade, **dubstep** and **drum-and-bass** remixes of metal songs (and vice versa) were not uncommon. There were also **rap-metal** crossovers beyond nu metal – for instance, **Tech N9ne** (a rapper) collaborated with metal artists, and bands like **Hollywood Undead** fused rap, rock, and metal in the late 2000s. Symphonic and **progressive metal** also thrived – e.g. **Dream Theater** consistently released top-charting prog metal albums (2002’s *Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence*, 2007’s *Systematic Chaos*), and **Opeth** from Sweden gained huge respect for their seamless blend of death metal with 1970s progressive rock. By the close of the 2000s, heavy metal encompassed a vast array of sounds – arguably more varied than ever – and had firmly entrenched itself in global youth culture, aided by the internet’s connective power.

**Notable Albums/Bands of the 2000s:** *Killswitch Engage’s* ***The End of Heartache* (2004)** and *As I Lay Dying’s* ***An Ocean Between Us* (2007)** – both Billboard-charting metalcore milestones. *Mastodon’s* ***Leviathan* (2004)** – a concept album about Moby Dick that heralded the return of prog-sludge ambition in metal. *Nightwish’s* ***Once* (2004)** – symphonic metal that topped charts in multiple countries and featured full orchestral arrangements. *Slipknot’s* ***Iowa* (2001)** and ***Vol. 3: (The Subliminal Verses)* (2004)** – which showed nu metal could evolve, incorporating extreme metal elements and still debuting at #1. *Lamb of God’s* ***Ashes of the Wake* (2004)** – a quintessential NWOAHM record blending groove/thrash technicality with modern bite, helping Lamb of God ascend as leaders of American metal. *Opeth’s* ***Blackwater Park* (2001)** – critically acclaimed for marrying death metal and progressive rock (produced by Steven Wilson of Porcupine Tree). *Dimmu Borgir’s* ***Death Cult Armageddon* (2003)** – which featured the Prague Philharmonic and brought black metal aesthetics to a cinematic peak (hitting #1 in Norway). *DragonForce’s* ***Inhuman Rampage* (2006)** – whose hyper-speed power metal track “Through the Fire and Flames” went viral via *Guitar Hero*, exemplifying power metal excess. *Trivium’s* ***Ascendancy* (2005)** – notable as a young band mixing metalcore with Metallica/Testament thrash influences, hinting at a thrash revival. *Baroness* and *The Ocean* (late ’00s) – pushing sludge/post-metal boundaries. And on the fringes, *Sunn O)))*’s ***Monoliths & Dimensions* (2009)** – a drone/avant-metal landmark showing metal’s experimental edge.

**Legacy of the 2000s:** Entering the 2010s, heavy metal was a **strong, globally-networked genre**. The 2000s ensured that metal did not just survive the ’90s alternative wave – it *thrived* in new forms. **Metalcore and deathcore** brought a new generation of fans who would carry metal into the next decade, some branching into even more experimental territory. The decade’s **digital transformation** permanently changed how metal communities operate – online discovery and promotion became as important as touring, allowing even niche sub-subgenres (from Viking metal to cybergrind) to find their audience. The **tradition-meets-innovation** dynamic of the 2000s (with retro revivals paralleling cutting-edge hybrids) continued into the 2010s, as many ’00s bands matured and many ’80s/’90s bands reunited or reinvented themselves. Importantly, by 2010 metal had cemented its status as more than music: it was a worldwide cultural phenomenon, complete with major festivals (Wacken Open Air in Germany had grown to 75,000 attendees by late 2000s), academic studies (the first **International Conferences on Metal Music Studies** occurred in late 2000s), and a multi-generational fanbase. Metal was ready to embrace the second decade of the 21st century with both horns up.

## 2010s: Diversity and Niche Innovations – Djent, Post-Metal, and New Crossovers

The 2010s were marked by an **unprecedented diversity in heavy metal**, as the genre continued to branch out into specialized niches and also saw unexpected crossovers into mainstream culture. No single subgenre dominated the decade; instead, the 2010s provided a rich **tapestry of styles**, each with its own dedicated following. Key trends included the rise of **djent and progressive metalcore**, the melding of black metal with shoegaze and post-rock (**blackgaze**), the mainstream flirtations of metal with pop and hip-hop, and a general *post-genre openness* where artists felt free to experiment beyond traditional boundaries. At the same time, many veteran metal bands from the ’80s and ’90s remained active and influential, headlining festivals and releasing well-received albums – giving the 2010s a sense of metal’s past coexisting with its future. Technology (streaming services, YouTube, social media like Facebook/Instagram) further transformed how fans consumed music and interacted, making it easier for micro-genres to find their global niche audience without major label support. By mid-decade, one could attend a mega-festival like **Hellfest** or **Wacken** and see everything from classic thrash legends to teenage deathcore breakdown artists to avant-garde post-metal noise within a single weekend – a testament to metal’s *broad church*.

**Djent and Modern Prog Metal:** In the 2010s, one of the buzzwords in metal was **“djent.”** Originating from an onomatopoeic description of a palm-muted guitar sound (the chunky “djen-djen” tone) used prominently by **Meshuggah** (Sweden’s extreme prog-metal pioneers), djent evolved into a subgenre movement. **Djent** is essentially a **spinoff of progressive metal** that emphasizes *rhythmic and technical complexity*: off-kilter, syncopated guitar riffs (often based on polymeters/polyrhythms), played with **high gain, heavily muted distortion** to achieve that distinctive percussive *chug*. Djent musicians typically favor **extended-range guitars** – 7, 8, or even 9 strings – to allow exceptionally low tunings for a deep, resonant sound. The drumming in djent mirrors the guitars with precise, machine-like patterns and frequent use of odd time signatures. Solos and lead sections, when present, often showcase **virtuosic shred**, tapping, and jazz-fusion influences. The djent scene emerged online around bands like **Periphery** (whose founder Misha Mansoor popularized the term on guitar forums) and **Tesseract** in 2010. *Periphery’s* debut album (2010) and *Tesseract’s* ***One* (2011)** were foundational djent releases, featuring a mix of harsh and clean vocals (influenced by metalcore and alt-metal) over Meshuggah-style rhythmic barrages. Other notable acts include **Animals as Leaders** (an instrumental trio blending djent rhythm with jazz-fusion soloing), **Meshuggah** themselves (who, though around since the ’90s, had a huge influence on this generation), **Monuments**, **Vildhjarta** (Sweden), and later **Polyphia** (who added hip-hop/trap beats to a djent/prog guitar approach). Djent’s **geographic scene** was largely *internet-based* – musicians from the US, UK, India, Australia, etc., connected via YouTube and forums to share techniques. By mid-2010s, djent had fully entered the prog metal mainstream: many progressive metalcore bands adopted djent elements (e.g. **Northlane**, **Erra**), and even established prog bands like Dream Theater incorporated some djent-like riffing on occasion. Djent also spurred improvements in **music production technology** – the demand for tight, low-tuned mixes led to specialized amp simulators, plugins, and drum software (many djent artists are bedroom-producers). The genre’s detractors sometimes argued it became formulaic, but its impact was undeniable: djent helped modernize progressive metal and attracted young musicians to push rhythmic boundaries in metal composition.

**Metalcore’s Evolution and “The New Wave of Prog Metal”:** The metalcore boom of the 2000s didn’t disappear in the 2010s; rather, it evolved. By early 2010s, **synthesizers and electronic influences** were being folded into metalcore more frequently, as noted with bands like **Asking Alexandria** and **The Devil Wears Prada**, whose 2011 releases saw notable chart success. *Asking Alexandria’s* ***Reckless & Relentless* (2011)** and TDWP’s ***Dead Throne* (2011)** both debuted in the top 10 of the Billboard 200, indicating metalcore’s still-strong commercial presence. These albums featured not just breakdowns and screams, but also **electronicore** elements – dance-like synthesizer lines, occasional auto-tuned vocals, etc. A subgenre dubbed **“ trancecore”** or **“electronicore”** applied rave synths to metalcore (e.g. **Enter Shikari** from the UK, **Crossfaith** from Japan). By mid-2010s, some metalcore bands shifted toward a more radio-friendly rock sound (e.g. **Bring Me the Horizon** started as deathcore in 2006, but by their 2013 album *Sempiternal* they incorporated atmospheric electronics and big melodic choruses to critical acclaim, and 2015’s *That’s the Spirit* was essentially melodic alt-metal which hit #2 in the US). This indicated an interesting cross-pollination: metalcore bands were **breaking out of the metal scene and into mainstream rock**, much like how in the ’80s some thrash bands crossed over. The 2010s also saw a **new wave of technical and progressive metalcore** often called the **“Sumerian-core”** scene (after Sumerian Records) or simply progressive metal. Bands like **Veil of Maya**, **After the Burial**, and **Born of Osiris** combined metalcore’s intensity with djent’s complexity and virtuoso musicianship, appealing to fans of both breakdowns and guitar solos. Meanwhile, more traditional metalcore persisted (hard-hitting acts like **Parkway Drive** from Australia became huge in the 2010s, graduating from metalcore to a groove-metal/arena-metal style by decade’s end and headlining major European festivals). **Deathcore**, too, continued with new influences: by late 2010s, deathcore bands like **Lorna Shore**, **Shadow of Intent** were incorporating symphonic orchestration (inspired by Dimmu Borgir or Fleshgod Apocalypse), creating a “symphonic deathcore” style. The song “To the Hellfire” (Lorna Shore, 2021) even went viral on TikTok for its over-the-top breakdowns and pig-squeal **“tunnel throat”** vocals – a sign that even extreme metal could find quirky exposure in the social media age. All told, the 2010s metalcore/deathcore landscape was one of refinement and diversification: some bands went more melodic and accessible, some more technical or brutal, keeping the genres alive and evolving.

**Blackgaze and Post-Metal:** One of the most surprising cross-genre movements of the 2010s was the fusion of **black metal with shoegaze and post-rock**, often termed **blackgaze**. Pioneered quietly by France’s **Alcest** in the late 2000s (e.g. album *Souvenirs d’un autre monde* (2007)), this style exploded into wider awareness with **Deafheaven’s** ***Sunbather* (2013)** – an album that received *widespread critical acclaim from far beyond the metal press*. Blackgaze typically retains **black metal’s harsh vocals and blast beats**, but layers them under **lush, dreamy guitar textures and soaring, melancholic melodies** reminiscent of shoegaze (think My Bloody Valentine) and **post-rock’s cinematic build-ups**. Deafheaven’s *Sunbather* featured lengthy tracks that ebb and flow between \*\*“dreamy post-rock, immense explosive climaxes, and cathartic payoffs”\*. The vocals were classic black metal rasps, but the emotion conveyed was oddly uplifting and deeply personal, with lyrics tackling introspective themes like longing and insecurity (though largely indecipherable without a lyric sheet). The album’s **pink cover art and vulnerable tone** defied black metal conventions, yet its intensity and beauty won over critics – *Sunbather* landed on many year-end “best album” lists and even Rolling Stone’s list of 100 greatest metal albums. This success inadvertently *“opened new doors for black metal”* by introducing the genre’s sound to indie-rock audiences. It also sparked debate among purists (some said Deafheaven “aren’t real black metal”), but the movement grew regardless. Other notable blackgaze/post-black metal acts of the 2010s include **Alcest** (who continued refining their ethereal metal, e.g. *Écailles de Lune*, 2010), **Bosse-de-Nage** (USA), **Ghost Bath**, **Lantlôs**, and **Astronoid** (who coined “dream thrash,” mixing black metal drumming with entirely clean vocals). Parallel to blackgaze, the **post-metal** genre (originally shaped by bands like Neurosis, Isis, Cult of Luna in the ’90s/’00s) matured – bands like **Alcest** (again), **Russian Circles**, **Pelican**, **The Ocean** released acclaimed albums blending sludge, post-rock and ambient elements into expansive metal soundscapes. The **atmospheric metal** trend demonstrated metal’s capacity for emotional depth and artistic experimentation beyond traditional aggression. By the end of the decade, elements of blackgaze/post-metal even seeped into **mainstream artists**: pop star **Taylor Swift** cited *Sunbather* as an influence on some production choices, and **Bartees Strange** and other indie artists openly drew from post-hardcore and blackgaze textures. While blackgaze remained a niche within metal, its legacy is the idea that *metal can be “beautiful” and devastating at once*, broadening the genre’s expressive range.

**Pop, Hip-Hop, and Metal – Unlikely Fusions:** The late 2010s saw some unusual genre-blurring moments where metal’s influence appeared in pop and hip-hop contexts. One noteworthy trend was a **revival of nu-metal influences in pop** – surprisingly led by young female artists like **Poppy**, **Grimes**, and **Rina Sawayama**. For instance, **Poppy’s** 2020 album *I Disagree* and **Rina Sawayama’s** *Sawayama* (2020) mix bubblegum pop and electropop with sudden heavy guitar riffs and screamed vocals, unabashedly channeling the **late-’90s nu metal sound (downtuned riffs, breakdowns)** alongside glossy production. *Grimes* (the Canadian electropop artist) incorporated a nu-metal aesthetic on songs like “We Appreciate Power” (2018), complete with guitars and industrial beats. Critics noted this as a *“popular and critical revival”* of nu metal style in the late 2010s – essentially nu-metal’s angst reimagined in hyperpop form. Simultaneously, an underground wave of **“trap metal”** or **“SoundCloud rap/metal”** emerged: artists such as **Ghostemane**, **Scarlxrd**, and **\$uicideboy\$** blended screamed vocals, metalcore/industrial-style instrumentation, and trap beats. For example, Scarlxrd (a UK artist) raps in a harsh scream over 808 bass drops and occasional metal riffs, clearly influenced by both hip-hop and hardcore. **Lil Peep** and **XXXTentacion**, before their untimely deaths, experimented with emo rock and metal touches in their hip-hop (a song like XXXTentacion’s “King” outright sampled a Slipknot track). While these artists were primarily classified as hip-hop or emo-rap, their embrace of metal’s aggression signaled the breakdown of genre barriers among Gen Z musicians. By the end of the decade, even an artist as mainstream as **Post Malone** professed love for metal (jamming onstage with Ozzy Osbourne in 2019 and featuring him on a track), and rapper **Lil Uzi Vert** sported a Marilyn Manson influence (even reportedly spending \$220k on a Manson chain). This cultural crossover indicated metal’s enduring appeal – its fashion and energy being absorbed into other genres. In metal circles, these pop and hip-hop flirtations were met with curiosity or skepticism, but they undeniably brought metal aesthetics to new audiences.

**Established Acts and New Chapters:** The 2010s were also a decade where many **legacy metal bands** delivered strong late-career work and remained hugely influential. For instance, **Iron Maiden** released *The Book of Souls* (2015) – a double album that topped charts globally, showing classic heavy metal’s staying power. **Black Sabbath** capped their career with a final album (*13*, 2013) and a farewell tour ending in 2017 in Birmingham – bringing the metal originators full circle. **Metallica**’s *Hardwired… to Self-Destruct* (2016) sold massively and proved thrash metal’s progenitors could still dominate arena stages. Slayer, Megadeth, Anthrax, Testament and other ’80s thrashers all continued touring and releasing albums (Slayer did retire in 2019 after a final world tour). **Judas Priest**’s *Firepower* (2018) was lauded as one of their best in decades. Extreme metal elders also thrived: *Cannibal Corpse*, *Behemoth*, *Amon Amarth* each achieved their highest chart positions in the 2010s, reflecting extreme metal’s acceptance in the broader metal community. The festival circuit boomed – in Europe especially, huge festivals (Wacken, Hellfest, Download, etc.) often sold out with headliners spanning multiple eras of metal. This live circuit support allowed veteran bands to coexist with new blood. Meanwhile, new bands in the **traditional styles** emerged – the so-called **New Wave of Traditional Heavy Metal (NWOTHM)** saw young bands like **Enforcer** (Sweden), **Striker** (Canada), **Night Demon** (US) playing classic NWOBHM-style metal; in thrash, a revival scene (“Thrash’s Second Wave”) had acts like **Havok**, **Power Trip**, **Municipal Waste** injecting fresh energy into old-school thrash. **Power metal** and **symphonic metal** continued strongly, especially in Europe and South America (Sabaton, a Swedish power metal band singing about war history, rose to headline arenas in the latter 2010s). Even **glam metal** found a niche revival (the “sleaze rock” underground in Scandinavia, and festivals like Rocklahoma in the US celebrating ’80s glam nostalgia).

**Global and Cultural Developments:** If the 2000s globalized metal, the 2010s amplified it. Metal scenes grew in countries like **India** (e.g. the Bangalore Open Air festival launched in 2012), **China** (the festival scene expanded, and metal bands appeared on Chinese TV talent shows!), **Indonesia** (a massive underground grindcore/death scene, with bands like Burgerkill gaining international note), and even **the Middle East** (Israel’s **Orphaned Land** toured worldwide blending metal and Middle Eastern music, and Iranian/Iraqi metal bands emerged despite adversity). The decade also saw metal increasingly used as a form of cultural expression and resistance in non-Western contexts – e.g. **Alien Weaponry**, a young thrash/groove band from New Zealand, wrote songs in the Māori language about indigenous struggles and explicitly promoted metal as a way to raise awareness against racism. They garnered international attention for their 2018 album *Tū*. Similarly, **Voice of Baceprot**, an all-female teen metal trio from Indonesia, made headlines in late 2010s for challenging stereotypes (performing in hijabs, singing about women’s empowerment through metal). These examples highlight how metal became a voice for marginalized or underrepresented groups, continuing a tradition of rebellion but in new cultural dimensions. The academic field of **Metal Music Studies** blossomed too – by the 2010s, numerous conferences, journals, and books analyzed metal’s musicology, culture, and social issues (scholars like **Deena Weinstein** and **Keith Kahn-Harris** expanded their works, and even topics like racism and gender in metal were studied, e.g. Laina Dawes’ book on black women in metal). In short, heavy metal by the end of the 2010s was both a **mature art form with 50+ years of history** and a continually renewing force driven by youth and innovation.

**Notable Albums/Bands of the 2010s:** *Deafheaven’s* ***Sunbather* (2013)** – a landmark in genre fusion, bringing black metal into indie consciousness. *Periphery’s* ***Periphery II* (2012)** and *Tesseract’s* ***Altered State* (2013)** – defining djent/prog albums that showcased rhythmic wizardry and clean vocal melodicism (Tesseract’s *Altered State* notably had all clean vocals, rare for a djent record). *Gojira’s* ***L’Enfant Sauvage* (2012)** and ***Magma* (2016)** – French progressive/groove metal band Gojira rose to prominence with their environmentally themed, rhythmically potent metal, even earning a Grammy nomination. *Ghost’s* ***Meliora* (2015)** – Swedish band Ghost combined Blue Öyster Cult/’70s metal vibes with a theatrical Satanic image and pop sensibility, achieving mainstream rock radio play and a Grammy award (Ghost’s success in the mid-2010s is noteworthy as a new band playing *clean-sung*, retro-tinged heavy rock reaching arena status). *Mastodon’s* ***The Hunter* (2011)** and ***Once More ’Round the Sun* (2014)** – continued their streak of critically acclaimed albums, bridging sludge and accessible hard rock. *Babymetal’s* self-titled (2014) – a totally unique Japanese phenomenon: three J-pop idol singers fronting a capable metal band, resulting in a viral crossover and coining “kawaii metal” (cute metal). Babymetal’s mix of power metal, metalcore, and idol pop (songs like “Gimme Chocolate!!”) showed the 2010s appetite for wild experimentation. *Code Orange’s* ***Forever* (2017)** – a breakthrough in metallic hardcore, blending elements of Nine Inch Nails-style industrial, metalcore, and even glitch electronics, which earned a Grammy nod and signaled the next generation of experimental heavy music. *Tool’s* ***Fear Inoculum* (2019)** – a late entry, but worth noting that Tool ended a 13-year hiatus with a prog-metal opus that topped charts, reflecting metal’s lasting commercial viability. *Power Trip’s* ***Nightmare Logic* (2017)** – hailed as a modern thrash classic with crossover appeal (tragically, their singer Riley Gale passed in 2020 just as the band was taking off). And *Turnstile’s* ***Time & Space* (2018)** – while more hardcore punk, it injected infectious groove and alt-rock flair that by 2021 made Turnstile one of the biggest new heavy bands (pointing to the ’90s alt-metal influence cycle coming back around).

**Legacy of the 2010s:** As the decade closed (and heading into the early 2020s), heavy metal stood as a **vast, multifaceted domain**. The 2010s reinforced that metal is not one sound but many – from the **most abrasive noise to polished pop-metal blends** – and that its ethos of *individuality and intensity* can manifest in countless ways. The cross-genre fertilization of the 2010s means that younger artists in the 2020s grew up with playlists that might shuffle Slayer, Slipknot, SoundCloud rap, EDM, and Deafheaven back-to-back. This eroded purist barriers and suggested a future where metal continues to evolve in unpredictable directions. The decade also saw metal’s **cultural acceptance** grow: metal fashion (band tees, etc.) became mainstream trendy, metal artists featured on movie soundtracks and video game scores, and the Grammy awards even briefly merged Hard Rock and Metal into one category (causing some controversy). Importantly, the 2010s firmly established that **metal is here to stay** – its pioneers still celebrated, its new innovators drawing fresh ears, and its community spanning continents and generations. The groundwork was laid for metal to continue thriving through the 2020s and beyond, ever adaptive yet true to its core spirit of powerful musical catharsis.

## 2020–2025: A New Decade – Resilience, Reinvention, and Reflections

The first half of the 2020s has presented heavy metal with unique challenges and opportunities. Globally, the decade began under the shadow of the **COVID-19 pandemic**, which in 2020–2021 abruptly halted live concerts and tours – the lifeblood of many metal communities. Tours were canceled or postponed, major festivals went on hiatus, and bands had to adapt by embracing **livestream performances and virtual fan engagement**. Many artists turned to composing and recording during lockdowns, resulting in a surge of new releases once studios reopened. The pandemic ultimately demonstrated metal’s *resilience*: fans supported bands through online merch sales and tuning into live-streamed shows (e.g. **Trivium** and **Behemoth** put on elaborate streamed concerts in empty arenas or historic locations). By 2022, live metal roared back with pent-up energy – festivals like **Wacken Open Air 2022** sold out instantly, signaling the community’s eagerness to reunite. Culturally, the 2020–2025 period has been one of **transition and reflection** for heavy metal. Many legendary bands are on their final chapters (e.g. **Kiss** and **Judas Priest** embarking on “final” tours, **Ozzy Osbourne** retiring from touring due to health in 2023, **Slayer** already concluded). This passing of the torch has prompted celebration of metal’s rich heritage (50th anniversaries for seminal albums by Black Sabbath, Deep Purple, etc. around 2020) and curiosity about the future torchbearers.

**Musical Direction:** No single new subgenre has yet defined the 2020s – rather, metal continues along the pluralistic path of the late 2010s. Trends include further **genre-blending** with outside influences and a conscious **revival of classic styles** by a younger generation. For example, a number of new bands are embracing a **’90s/early ’00s nu-metal and metalcore revival** (sometimes dubbed *“nu-metalcore”*): bands like **Tetrarch**, **Tallah**, and **Wargasm (UK)** unabashedly incorporate nu-metal grooves, turntables, and rap-screamed vocals, updating that sound with metalcore polish – an evolution partly inspired by the late-2010s pop nu-metal revival by Poppy/Grimes. At the same time, **classic thrash and traditional metal** remain in healthy rotation – *old guard* thrashers like **Metallica, Megadeth, Kreator, Sodom** released well-received albums in 2021–2022 that largely stick to their roots, and newcomers like **Enforcer** or **Haunt** carry the NWOTHM flag. **Death metal** in the 2020s has been fertile: there’s an OSDM (“old-school death metal”) revival with bands like **Blood Incantation** and **Gatecreeper** adopting raw 90s styles, while others push forward with dissonant, avant-garde death metal (e.g. **Imperial Triumphant** blending jazz). **Black metal** too sees both preservation (Norway’s classic bands still active) and innovation (more bands incorporating synthwave or post-punk elements, as well as a rise of **“atmospheric black metal”** focusing on nature themes – e.g. **Panopticon** from the US mixing Appalachian folk and black metal). The **“post-”** trend continues: **post-metal, post-hardcore, shoegaze-metal** hybrids are almost mainstream in certain circles (Deafheaven even switched to mostly clean vocals on 2021’s *Infinite Granite*, basically becoming a shoegaze band, which divided fans but showed the fluidity of genre definitions). **Metalcore and deathcore** remain popular, with some bands venturing into *proggier or more melodic territory* (e.g. **Spiritbox** – whose 2021 debut hit #13 US – combines djenty metalcore with ethereal vocals and electronic ambience) and others doubling down on extremity (like **Brand of Sacrifice** adding video-game soundtrack grandiosity to deathcore). We also see **crossover collaborations**: in 2020, rapper **Ghostemane** released an album (*ANTI-ICON*) that is half trap, half industrial-black-metal; in 2021, *Bring Me the Horizon* collaborated with pop artist **YUNGBLUD** and Japanese kawaii-metal act **Babymetal** on different tracks, illustrating the genre’s widened network.

**Technology & Media:** Streaming has fully taken over as the primary mode of music consumption in the 2020s, which has both ups and downs for metal. On one hand, *legacy acts* benefit from huge back-catalog streaming numbers (Metallica’s “Master of Puppets” even went viral in 2022 due to a *Stranger Things* TV show placement, climbing Spotify charts and introducing a new generation to thrash). On the other hand, newer metal bands face the challenge of competing for attention in algorithm-driven environments often dominated by pop/hip-hop – however, metal’s dedicated fanbase still often buys physical media like vinyl and supports artists on platforms like Bandcamp (which many metal labels utilize to sell directly to fans). Social media trends occasionally bring metal into the spotlight: TikTok has seen viral memes involving metal (e.g. “Thunderstruck” by AC/DC as a challenge, or sea shanties leading some to discover pirate/folk metal). The **global reach** of metal is ever-apparent: during the pandemic, multi-band live-stream festivals featured bands from dozens of countries; metal musicians collaborate across continents via file-sharing.

**Sociocultural Factors:** The turbulent early 2020s (pandemic, political unrest, war in Ukraine, climate anxieties) have given metal plenty of topical fuel. Lyrics addressing mental health – perhaps influenced by the isolation of lockdowns – are prevalent, as are songs about societal collapse or hope for unity in dark times. For instance, **Gojira**’s 2021 album *Fortitude* has songs urging activism for indigenous rights and environmental protection (themes continuing their eco-conscious stance). Metal communities have also become more vocally inclusive in recent years: there’s ongoing dialogue about racism, sexism, and LGBTQ+ representation in metal (a scene historically maligned for these issues). Festivals and labels have started to showcase more diverse lineups, and movements like the **Afro-punk metal** scene or **Women in Metal** advocacy gained momentum, in line with broader social awareness.

**Notable Developments (2020–2025):**

* **Metallica** releasing *72 Seasons* in 2023, which hit #1 in many countries (though #2 in the US) – proving that a major metal release can still dominate charts against pop competition, and highlighting the band’s multigenerational fan appeal (the album’s themes reflect on 40+ years of Metallica’s journey).
* The tragic loss of some metal icons: e.g. **Children of Bodom** frontman Alexi Laiho died in 2020, **Entombed**’s LG Petrov in 2021, reminding the community of the genre’s aging heroes and spurring tributes.
* **System of a Down** (nu-metal era giants) unexpectedly released two new songs in 2020 after a 15-year hiatus, addressing the war in their ethnic homeland Artsakh – showing how metal bands respond to geopolitical events (the songs raised funds for Armenian charity).
* **Online Collaborations**: Projects like **Metal Allegiance** and **Teenage Time Killer** (actually mid-2010s) continued into 2020s, with all-star metal musicians recording remotely together – a trend amplified by pandemic conditions.
* **NFTs and Metal**: A few metal artists experimented with NFTs (non-fungible tokens) as a new medium for art/merch, although the trend is nascent and met with skepticism by some fans.
* **AI in Metal**: By 2023, AI-generated music is a hot topic. There have been AI-generated “in the style of” metal songs circulating for fun, and some musicians use AI tools for production assistance. While not a major factor yet, it raises questions of how technology might shape metal production and creativity in coming years.

**Live Scene Post-Pandemic:** 2022–2023 saw an explosion of tours as bands made up for lost time. Notably, **stadium tours** combining metal and hard rock acts (like Motley Crue/Def Leppard reunion, not metal per se but adjacent) proved lucrative, and Metallica announced an ambitious **“No Repeat Weekend” tour for 2023–24** with two-night stadium stands (each night different setlist and support acts like Pantera’s tribute lineup and Mammoth WVH), indicating that top-tier metal acts remain huge draws. There’s also been a resurgence of **metal festivals in new regions**: e.g. the **Middle East’s Desertfest** in Dubai launched, **South America** and **Asia** see more international metal tours (Maiden, Metallica, Slipknot regularly hit those markets now). The festival culture, anchored by events like Hellfest (France) and Wacken (Germany), has arguably never been stronger – Hellfest 2022 famously spanned 7 days, 350+ bands, covering nearly every subgenre, illustrating metal’s breadth and fan devotion.

**The Pantera Tribute & 90s Nostalgia:** In late 2022, surviving members of Pantera (Phil Anselmo and Rex Brown) reunited onstage for the first time in over 20 years alongside Zakk Wylde and Charlie Benante, to celebrate Pantera’s music on a world tour (billed somewhat controversially under the Pantera name). This reflects a wave of ’90s nostalgia in metal: fans who grew up on those bands are eager to relive them, and younger fans who never got the chance are enthusiastic as well. Similarly, **90s alt-metal bands** like **Korn**, **Deftones**, **Tool**, **Rage Against the Machine** (who attempted a reunion tour in 2022) have been headlining festivals, demonstrating the cyclical resurgence of that era’s music.

**Legacy & Influence:** As of 2025, heavy metal stands as a **multigenerational cultural force**. The 2020s so far have underscored the genre’s adaptability – whether through embracing new technology, surviving a global pandemic, or absorbing influences from across the musical spectrum. Metal’s **global footprint** is now firmly established – it’s listened to and performed all around the world, from major cities to remote villages, often localized with unique cultural twists. The “metal family” has arguably grown closer through shared hardship (the pandemic) and the celebratory return of live music. Going forward, the influence of the 2020–2025 period will likely be seen in how bands integrate the **lessons of lockdown** (e.g. creative use of digital content alongside live shows) and how the new wave of artists who emerged or came of age in this time (Spiritbox, Jinjer, Turnstile, etc.) carry metal’s torch. If one thing is clear, it’s that heavy metal – born in the late ’60s, forged in ’70s steel mills, unleashed on ’80s stages, contorted in the ’90s underground, reborn in the 2000s, and diversified in the 2010s – continues to evolve while remaining true to its essence: **powerful, cathartic, and uniting through the shared love of loud, heavy music**.

Also influenced by Thrash (speed) and Emo (melodic choruses in some cases).                                                                                     | **Killswitch Engage** – *Alive or Just Breathing* (2002); **As I Lay Dying** – *Shadows Are Security* (2005).

Emotive, dreamy yet intense – finding “beauty in extremity.” Deafheaven’s *Sunbather* gained wide critical acclaim, introducing this fusion beyond metal circles.                                                                                      |

| **Symphonic Metal** (’90s/’00s)                                    | Power Metal/Gothic Metal + Classical Orchestra/Opera. Influenced by film scores and Romantic-era classical.                                                                                                                                               | **Nightwish** – *Once* (2004); **Therion** – *Theli* (1996).
